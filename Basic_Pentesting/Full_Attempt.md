### Room: Basic Pentesting
### Target IP: 10.10.246.76

## Task 1: Web App Testing and Privilege Escalation

#### Task 1.a: Deploy the machine and connect to our network.

`Task 1.a Answer: No answer needed`

#### Task 1.b: Find the services exposed by the machine.

First I'll start by doing some basic `nmap` enumeration. 
I usually like double checking nmap results with `rustscan`. 
Rustscan is much faster so I typically use it to scan all ports.

`nmap 10.10.246.76 -sV -v | tee version_scan`

Note ports and services:

|-PORT:

|--22: ssh => OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu

|--80: http => Apache httpd 2.4.18

|--139: netbios-ssn => Samba smbd

|--445: netbios-ssn => Sanba smbd

|--8009: ajp13 => Apache Jerv (Protocol v1.3)

|--8080: http => Apache Tomcat 9.0.7

`Task 1.b Answer: No answer needed`

#### Task 1.c: What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server?

I'll start by running a quick `gobuster` scan on the webserver
nmap discovered on `port 8080`.

`gobuster dir -u http://10.10.246.76:8080 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`

|-Directories:

|--/docs

|--/examples

|--/favicon.ico

|--/host-manager

|--/manager

`/manager` seems interesting but navigating there reveals
that it is password protected. I'm going to enumerate
further before diving too deep here first.

There was also another webserver running on `port 80` that I will enumerate.

`gobuster dir -u http://10.10.246.76 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`

This reveals only one result `/development`. Navigating
there reveals a directory with some developer notes: `dev.txt` and `j.txt`

`Task 1.c Answer: development`

#### Task 1.d: User brute-forcing to find the username & password

I'll save the developer notes incase I need to reference them later.

`wget http://10.10.246.76/development/dev.txt`

`wget http://10.10.246.76/development/j.txt`

#### Task 1.e: What is the password?

#### Task 1.f: What service do you use to access the server?

#### Task 1.g: Enumerate the machine to find any vertors for privilege escalation

#### Task 1.h: If you have found another user, what can you do with this information?

#### Task 1.i: What is the final password you obtain?
